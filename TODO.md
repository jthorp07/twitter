# Frontend

- [ ] `Refactor BASIC mode HTML: Action bar should be two rows with top having keywords & tag inputs, bottom having all toggle buttons`
- [ ] `At least some popup to view tweets from the stream`
- [ ] `When sending request to stop viewing, break recursive requests` 
- [ ] `Add authentication so users can log in with their own Twitter Dev accounts without a config file (likely will not be secure)`

# Backend

- [ ] `Make sure stop request actually resets stream rules to prevent going over monthly Tweet limit`
- [ ] `Add authentication so users can log in with their own Twitter Dev accounts without a config file (likely will not be secure)`
